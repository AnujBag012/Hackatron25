      description: "With the increasing exchange of digital documents, especially PDFs, ensuring the privacy of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has become a crucial challenge. Organizations handling sensitive documents—such as financial reports, legal contracts, and medical records—must comply with data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA. However, manually redacting PII is time-consuming and prone to human error. To address this, propose an automated solution that detects PII in PDFs, replaces it with masked values or placeholders, and generates a new sanitized document while preserving formatting.",
